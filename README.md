# Manual reading guidelines
* Chapter 1: Very general introduction. Is it helpful for the practical calculation skills? No. Thus, it is recommended to just through once and put more effort on the other important chapters. Recommendation **%**%%%%%
* Chapter 2: Mention the units. Recommendation **%%**%%%%

# Useful information
